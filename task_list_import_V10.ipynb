    "There has been an error with the import process possibly due to an update to Sisu. Generally, when we import task lists and their resident tasks we would import the `Buyer/Seller code` as `client_type_id` for the task lists and would leave the `client_type_id` blank for the tasks. Once imported the task list status use to imprint on the tasks, but now doesn't and the blank `client_type_id` is being interpreted as `both` or `All` in Sisu. To fix this, for now, I have the code filling the `client_type_id` for the tasks. Current tests are showing this works. "

The issue is that if the assignee is not in the Sisu User Database, then there is no assignee number for the task to be assigned to and will result in the task being uploaded without an assignee designated. \n",

I did not put this check later, where we were initially pulling in agent data, for convenience and also for the process. If we find out at that point, we will already have the task lists imported and having to pause and wait will burden our bandwidth (mentally). This way, if we get the error it is no big deal because we haven't started the process. (Stopping later also messes up the count within the tool -- not a huge deal, but worth avoiding.)\n",
